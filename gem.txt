Create a basic but functional UI for my AI-Powered Personal Finance Assistant using HTML, CSS, and Flask. The UI should not be extremely basic; it should look like a clean dashboard app rather than plain text pages.

Requirements:

Project Structure:

A Flask backend (app.py) that serves HTML templates.

A templates/ folder with Jinja2 HTML templates.

A static/ folder for CSS styling.

Pages to Include:

Home Dashboard: Overview cards showing:

Current balance (mock data).

Monthly budget progress (with a progress bar).

Savings suggestions (sample text).

Transactions Page: A table that displays mock transactions (date, category, amount, description).

Goals Page: A form where the user can enter financial goals (goal name, target amount, deadline) and a list that shows added goals.

Reports Page: Placeholder section for future insights and charts (e.g., “Weekly Spending Trends”).

UI Elements:

A sidebar navigation (Home, Transactions, Goals, Reports).

Cards for quick stats on the dashboard.

A progress bar for budget usage.

A styled table for transactions.

Use CSS with a modern look (soft colors, rounded corners, hover effects, simple responsive design).

Flask Features:

Use render_template for serving pages.

Use mock data for transactions, balance, and budgets (hardcode in app.py for now).

Demonstrate a POST request on the Goals Page for adding a new goal (store in memory for now).

Styling Guidelines:

Use a consistent color scheme (e.g., navy blue, white, light grey, green for positive values).

Rounded corners, card shadows, hover highlights.

Avoid inline CSS — keep styles in a static/style.css file.

Goal:

The final output should be a basic but professional-looking finance dashboard with multiple pages and working navigation powered by Flask. It should not be just plain HTML forms; instead, it should resemble an early prototype of a financial assistant app.
